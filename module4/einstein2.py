"""
Write a Python program to implement one of Einsteinâ€™s favorite puzzles:
1. Enter a 3 digit number. The first and last digit differ by at least two.
e.g. 742 is correct but 244 is not since the first and last digit differ by -2.
2. Reverse the input.
3. Subtract the reversed number from the original number.
4. Reverse the difference.
5. Add the difference to the reversed difference.
6. The sum should be 1089.

# 1. Enter a 3 digit number.

# 3. Subtract the reversed number from the original number.
difference = int(number) - int(reversed_number)
# 4. Reverse the difference.
reversed_difference = str(difference)[::-1]
# 5. Add the difference to the reversed difference.
