Use a while loop to repeat instructions an unknown number of times, until a condition is met. 
e.g.: ask a user for a number between 1 and 10.
We don't know how many times the user may enter a incorrect, so the program keeps asking while the number is not between 1 and 10. 
If the you know exactly how many times to execute instructions, then use a for loop!"""
