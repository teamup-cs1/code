"""
Write a program that asks for multiple scientist names and birth years :)
1. e.g.
Name, birth year: anna, 1998
Name, birth year: taylor, 1996
Name, birth year: eric, 2003
Name, birth year: ashley, 2001
2. Create a dictionary with key name, and value birth year.
3. Next, your program should swap the keys and the values.
4. Sort the dictionary from youngest to oldest student.
